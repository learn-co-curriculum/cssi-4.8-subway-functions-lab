# A subway story

# You hop on the subway at Union Square. As you are waiting for the train you take a look at the subway map. The map is about 21 inches wide and 35 inches tall. Let's write a method to puts the area of the map:
def map_size(width, height):
    map_area= width * height
    return "The map is %d square inches" %(map_area)

# Now you give it a shot! It takes about 156 seconds to go between stops and you'll be taking the train for 3 stops. Write a method that puts how long your trip will take.
def trip_length
  #  put your code here

# While you are waiting for the train you decide to play a little dice. Create a method called roll that puts a random number between 1 and 6 (feel free to google "how to generate a random number in ruby").

# write your code here




# The train arrives and you hop on. Guess what time it is? It's showtime! There are 23 people on the train and each person gives the dancers 1.5 dollars. Write a method that puts how much money they made.



# There is one grumpy lady on the train that doesn't like the dancing though. Write a method called stop_dancing that puts a message to the dancers in all caps.




# There is also a really enthusiastic rider who keeps shouting "Everything is awesome!" Write a method that puts everything is awesome 5 times. (Ruby has a times method that can help you do this.)





# You are almost at your stop and you start thinking about how you are going to get home. You have $18 dollars left on your metro card. Write a method that puts how many trips you have left.





# Call your methods below:
print "How big is that subway map?"
# call your method here - like this
map_size(21,35)

print "This is how long the trip will take"
trip_length

print "While I was waiting I rolled a"
# call your method here

print "How much money did the train dancers make?"
# call your method here

print "That lady told the train dancers to"
# call your method here

print "That guy kept shouting"
# call your method here

print "This is how many trips I have left on my metrocard"
# call your method here
